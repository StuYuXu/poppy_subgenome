# Subgenome evolution at gene-level and regulatory-level in opium poppy (*Papaver somniferum* L.)

## Introduction
In this research, we used *P. somniferum* as a model system to study of the evolution of coding sequences, noncoding regulatory sequences and transcriptome following recent WGD event, respectively and their relationship interactively.
